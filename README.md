🚀 Exciting News: My Sales Prediction Project is Making Strides, Now with Real-time Predictions! 📈

I'm thrilled to share an update on my Sales Prediction Project, where I'm harnessing the power of data and machine learning to transform the way we forecast sales. But that's not all - I've taken it a step further and deployed my model with a sleek Flask app and API for real-time predictions! 🤖🌐

## The Challenge

In the dynamic world of retail, accurate sales predictions are crucial for optimizing inventory, improving customer satisfaction, and making data-driven decisions. However, with countless factors at play, from product characteristics to store locations, it's a complex puzzle to solve.

## My Solution

I've embarked on a journey to build a robust sales prediction model that considers a multitude of variables. My data preprocessing pipeline handles categorical and numeric features with finesse, including clever strategies for encoding, one-hot encoding, and scaling. But I didn't stop there!
